	<p class="par1">SS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in<a href="#"> CSS </a>yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.</a>
Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it out as a normal CSS file that you can use in your web site.</p></div>
	<p>Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the<a href="#"> $ symbol </a>to make something a variable. </p>
	<p>When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.
Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your <a href="#">HTML</a>. Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.</p>
